- register,login,logout,delete account implemetation. Full support for the basic
  implementation of user account management. The focus of this is only the
  functionality in the backend and not the user interface. The user interface
  might just be basic for the sole purpose of testing
- better implementation of csrf protection. The implementation should allow the
  ability to enable and disable csrf protection. As there is no need for csrf in
  the tests( unless testing the implementation itself).
- add https support. Add more options in the configuration file to allow
  enabling and disabling https.
- Improve documentation
